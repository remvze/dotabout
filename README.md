### What Is Dotabout?

**Dotabout** is an open-source bio platform that reads your profile data directly from a GitHub repository.

All you need is:

- A **public repo** named `.about`
- An `about.json` file inside it

Your bio page becomes instantly available at:

```
https://dotabout.me/@<your-github-username>
```

Because your data lives entirely in your own repo, you **fully own and control it**. If you delete the repo, your profile disappears: no accounts, no lock-in.

---

### How It Works

1. Create a new public repository named `.about`
2. Add an `about.json` file inside it (you can copy it from [here](https://github.com/remvze/dotabout/blob/main/template/about.json))
3. Fill in your data according to the [schema](https://github.com/remvze/dotabout/blob/main/docs/schema.md)

Then visit your profile at:

```
https://dotabout.me/@<your-github-username>
```
